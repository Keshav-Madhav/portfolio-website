# Portfolio Website

Personal portfolio for Keshav Madhav (AI Engineer at VerbaFlo). Static-prerendered Next.js 13 App Router site, but with an unusually rich interactive layer: smooth scroll, multiple canvas backgrounds, a companion "spirit guide" orb, real-time multiplayer cursors and reactions, keyboard navigation, and a Konami easter egg. The whole decorative layer mounts on `requestIdleCallback` so it doesn't fight LCP.

## What the visitor experiences

The home page is a single long scroll: Hero → About → Work → Projects → Stack → Contact. There's also `/about` which is a faux IDE that renders content from `lib/data.ts` as synthetic markdown files in a tabbed editor.

While scrolling:

- Aurora blobs drift behind the content with parallax (`components/backdrop.tsx`).
- A particle network in front renders ~24–60 connected dots that repel from the cursor (`components/ui/particle-field.tsx`).
- A second particle layer with cursor glow adds depth (`components/ui/flow-field.tsx`).
- Click anywhere → a 12-line spark burst (`components/ui/click-spark.tsx`).
- Scroll fast → the `<main>` skews subtly via a CSS transform driven by a `data-fast-scroll` attribute set by `components/ui/velocity-tilt.tsx`.
- A glowing companion orb (the **Spirit Guide**) drifts around the cursor, expresses emotions through color and faces, runs a tour of interactive elements on idle, and reacts to fast scrolls and idle gestures (`components/ui/spirit-guide.tsx`).
- If anyone else is on the site, you see their cursor and they see yours; press `1`–`9` to send floating emoji reactions (`components/ui/multiplayer.tsx`, Ably-backed).
- `g h/a/w/p/s/c` are two-key keyboard shortcuts; `?` shows the help modal (`components/ui/keyboard-nav.tsx`).
- `↑↑↓↓←→←→ b a` triggers a Konami flash + emoji burst (`components/ui/konami.tsx`).

## The deferred-effects pattern (the performance story)

The site is tuned aggressively for LCP. `app/layout.tsx` mounts the smallest possible eager shell. `components/deferred-effects.tsx` waits for `requestIdleCallback` (or 800ms `setTimeout` fallback) before dynamically importing and mounting Lenis, both canvas backgrounds, the spirit guide, the multiplayer layer, keyboard nav, Konami, click-spark, velocity-tilt, and the toaster — each as its own JS chunk (`ssr: false`).

The first ~800ms of scrolling uses native browser scroll. Then Lenis takes over seamlessly. The hero's lede paragraph deliberately renders without entrance animation so it can serve as the LCP element (the original animated entrance was costing ~1300ms on LCP audits).

**Cross-cutting rule**: never add a new globally-mounted client effect to `app/layout.tsx`. Add it to `components/deferred-effects.tsx`. The two effects mounted eagerly (`Backdrop`, `ScrollProgress`) are intentional exceptions.

## The `data-spirit` attribute system

The spirit guide reads attributes off the page rather than exposing a JS API. Section components mark interactive elements:

- `data-spirit` — generic interactive element; orb can target it during exploration.
- `data-spirit="button"` — CTA-style; smaller halo.
- `data-spirit="inline"` — inline link; color lift on hover.
- `data-spirit="stats"` — special; intro-tour fallback target.
- `data-spirit-first` — the hero CTA; first stop on grand tour and intro-guidance target.
- `data-spirit-touched="true"` — set/cleared by the spirit guide itself; CSS keys glow intensification off it. Don't touch it manually.

If you add a clickable card or button and want the orb to react, just add the attribute. The orb scans on every animation frame during a tour and every ~5s during idle. See `components/ui/CLAUDE.md` for the full spirit-guide behavior tree.

## The multiplayer layer (Ably)

`components/ui/multiplayer.tsx` hooks into Ably + `@ably/spaces` for live cursors and emoji reactions. Disabled when `NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTIPLAYER_ENABLED !== "1"` or on touch-only devices.

- The browser **never sees `ABLY_API_KEY`** — it's gated behind `app/api/ably/token/route.ts` which mints short-lived token requests.
- Cursors are published in **page coordinates** (not viewport). The cursor/reaction layer wrappers apply `translate3d(0, -scrollY, 0)` imperatively via RAF — zero React re-renders during scroll, no matter how many remote cursors are on screen.
- Visitor identity (`{name, color}`) is generated once and persisted in `localStorage` via `lib/cursor-identity.ts` so colors are stable across sessions.
- Reactions are 1–9 keys → emoji PNGs in `/public/reactions/` (preloaded on mount to avoid first-press flash).

Full details in `components/ui/CLAUDE.md`.

## Data is centralized

All visible content (bio, projects, experience, nav, stack, internal-tools showcase) lives in `lib/data.ts`. **Never inline copy into components.** The `nav` array is `as const` and `SectionName` in `lib/types.ts` is derived from it — adding a nav entry automatically extends the type. Static images are imported (not string paths) so Next can fingerprint them and infer dimensions.

The `/about` page is a faux IDE that synthesizes "files" (`intro.md`, `now.md`, `projects.md`, `stack.json`, etc.) by interpolating `lib/data.ts` exports at render time.

## Cross-cutting rules

- `m.*` from framer-motion, **never** `motion.*` (only `domAnimation` is loaded).
- Section components must call `useSectionInView("Name", threshold)` from `lib/hooks.ts` and attach the returned ref to their outer `<section id="...">`. The hook ignores in-view changes for 1s after a nav click — without that debounce, the highlight flickers.
- New globally-mounted effects → `deferred-effects.tsx`, not `app/layout.tsx`.
- API routes set `runtime: "nodejs"` and `dynamic: "force-dynamic"`. Read secrets from `process.env` *inside* the handler.
- For mouse-tracking effects, use `useCachedRect` from `lib/use-cached-rect.ts` instead of reading `getBoundingClientRect()` per `pointermove`.
- Bail out under `useReducedMotion()` — return null for canvas effects, plain text for text effects.
- Pause RAF on `document.visibilitychange` (`document.hidden`).
- Path alias `@/*` resolves to the repo root (see `tsconfig.json`).

## Env vars

- `RESEND_API_KEY` — server-only, contact form delivery (`app/api/contact/route.ts`).
- `ABLY_API_KEY` — server-only, mints Ably tokens for the browser (`app/api/ably/token/route.ts`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTIPLAYER_ENABLED` — `"1"` to enable the multiplayer layer. The only client-exposed env.

`.env.example` documents these.

## Dev commands

- `npm run dev` — Next dev server (default port 3000).
- `npm run build` — production build. Run before claiming a change is shipped.
- `npm run lint` — `next lint`.

There are no automated tests in this repo — verify changes by running `npm run dev` and clicking through the affected sections (and ideally with reduced motion enabled to confirm the bail-outs still work).

## Where to read more

- `app/CLAUDE.md` — page + API route conventions
- `components/CLAUDE.md` — section + provider patterns, deferred-effects rules, the `data-spirit` attribute system
- `components/ui/CLAUDE.md` — every UI atom, every effect, the full spirit-guide behavior tree, the full multiplayer architecture
- `lib/CLAUDE.md` — data shape, hook semantics, accent palette
- `context/CLAUDE.md` — why active-section context exists (and why it shouldn't grow)
